          Before my interest in programming, I was a full-time personal trainer and bartender on the side. Fitness and health was and is still a huge factor in my lifestyle. When the pandemic occurred, it helped me realize that I had to make a huge decision for myself. I wanted to continue training, but I was also concerned about my familyâ€™s well-being. I sought out the path of becoming a programmer to have the chance to provide for my family in case another pandemic were to occur in the future. I want to have a higher probability of keeping my job and continue supporting my family. In the process, I fell in love with programming and the endless amount of material I could possibly learn. Microstrategy is a company I want to work for because of the doors it could open up. It is a company that promotes diversity, innovation, and growth. I am very enthusiastic to continue learning and emerge in new experiences that Microstrategy has to offer.
